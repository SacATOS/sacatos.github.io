# What is ATOS?
The Autonomous Transportation Open Standards Lab (ATOS) is a public-private partnership being developed to create a testbed for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in Sacramento. As a consortium, ATOS will facilitate collaboration among public agencies at all levels of government, industry partners, and experts to test and demonstrate CAV technologies in the real world. ATOS will document and open source its experience to accelerate the deployment and adoption of CAV technologies in other cities.

# Why was ATOS created?
ATOS was created to accelerate the testing, deployment, and adoption of CAVs. With the development and testing of emerging CAV technologies in isolation, critical questions must be answered about how these technologies converge within a single interoperable ecosystem to maximize public safety benefits. We know that CAVs will eventually eliminate nearly all of the 1.25 million traffic fatalities that occur year year around the world. ATOS seeks to accelerate toward that future.

# Who’s behind ATOS? Who are the current members of the consortium?
Building on Sacramento’s recent momentum, Congresswoman Doris Matsui, State Senator Richard Pan, Mayor Darrell Steinberg, and Sacramento Kings Chairman Vivek Ranadivé came together to co-create ATOS in order to establish a beachhead for innovation and technology to flourish in Sacramento. These leaders were inspired by the vision of innovation strategist Jay Sales, Director of The Shop at VSP Global. ATOS is in the process of recruiting potential consortium members who will drive the overall direction of the partnership.

# Is there a membership fee to join ATOS?
A robust implementation of CAV technologies in a real-world urban area will require investment in sensors, infrastructure, and data systems that ensure vehicles can communicate with each other and the environment around them. By establishing a true public-private partnership, these costs can be shared across multiple public agencies and industry partners. We are currently seeking feedback on whether it makes sense to charge a membership fee on a sliding scale or if the necessary investments can be made outside of a formal membership fee structure.

# What do you mean by “open standards”?
We appreciate the investments that CAV OEMs have made in their technologies and are committed to ensuring that the intellectual property of ATOS members is protected. By “open standards,” we’re referring to the exchange of data and information that will help ensure the algorithmic coordination of people and objects moving along Sacramento’s roads. For example, Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) includes a set of protocols that enable one and two-way communication between and among vehicles and infrastructure. ATOS will help advance the adoption of the optimal set protocols across different use cases as open standards for voluntary adoption by other cities and regions. The development of open standards will enable CAV technology to scale in the most cost-effective way possible.

# What should I expect at the April 19 meeting?
The April 19 stakeholder meeting is the first meeting in which the ATOS concept will be presented to potential partners. Following a presentation on the overall vision from the ATOS principals, along with a more in-depth overview of how we envision testing in the ATOS-designated area, we will begin a discussion to elicit feedback from attendees. The discussion primarily will focus on the ATOS structure and how Sacramento can best position itself among the competitive landscape of cities desiring to attract CAVs. Topics will include: investments needed, network infrastructure, data systems, communication protocols, and federal and state policy.

# Will press/media be invited to the April 19 meeting?
The April 19 stakeholder meeting is closed to the public and press/media in order to foster a candid conversation and protect the privacy of meeting participants. However, a readout may follow the meeting that describes the overall vision and purpose without disclosing the affiliations of those who attended or expressed interest in ATOS.

# Does the City of Sacramento have a policy for autonomous vehicles?
In conversations with potential industry partners, we’ve heard a consistent message about the need to avoid a patchwork of regulations across jurisdictions. The California Department of Vehicles (DMV) currently is at a critical point in the development of regulations that include provisions for interaction between OEMs and local governments. We are currently seeking feedback from potential industry partners as to whether it makes sense at this point in time to develop an autonomous vehicles policy at the city-level.

# Where is the designated testing area?
The designated testing area envisioned comprises a zone containing over 100 miles of roads for the testing, development and deployment of CAV technology. The area encompasses Midtown, Downtown, and the Interstate 5 corridor from Sacramento International Airport to the urban core, and will be utilized as a testing area for up to Level 5 CAVs.

# How soon can we test an autonomous vehicle on Sacramento’s roads?
ATOS intends to move forward with a phased approach. That approach might begin with a connected vehicle pilot, followed by autonomous shuttles on dedicated, fixed routes. Based on results, ATOS might continue with testing of SAE Levels 3 (conditional) and 4 (high) automated vehicles. Finally, ATOS would test SAE Level 5 (full) automated vehicles on roads shared with non-automated vehicles. Initial testing phases can begin immediately. Later phases are contingent upon state regulations. However, current DMV draft regulations that would permit Level 5 testing could become operative in Q4 2017.

# What is ATOS doing about federal and state policy?
Clearly, federal and state policy must authorize an environment for the testing and deployment of CAVs envisioned by ATOS. The direction and timing of current regulatory efforts appear to be compatible with ATOS’ timeline. Because the ATOS principals collectively represent all three levels of government, we may request any necessary designations or exemptions if our industry partners commit themselves to the consortium’s vision and goals.

# Are you working with other cities/regions?
We are interested in collaborating with other cities/regions who share our commitment to open standards. The City of Sacramento is a member of the Smart Cities Collaborative, in addition to other national networks that encourage the sharing of best practices. ATOS is premised on the ability to replicate and scale our experience to other cities and regions globally.
